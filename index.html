    I attended Zip Code Wilmington Java bootcamp in Spring of 2017.  I have been working in data warehousing on Hadoop since then.  I have a few java labs from Zip Code in my repos.  At my day job, I have been using Python, Bash and HiveQL (SQL-like query language).  I am trying to learn more about NFTs and crypto.
